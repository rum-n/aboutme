**Hi! My name is Rumen and I'm a Fullstack Developer, currently based in Sofia, Bulgaria.**

I spent the first 6 years of my career working in IT sales and project management. During this time, I realized I'd much rather be involved in the actual creation of digital products. I used my free time to try out different web technologies and work on many side projects. 

This helped me find a full-time job as a Frontend Developer and that's the start of my coding journey.
