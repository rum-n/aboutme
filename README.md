** Hi! My name is Rumen and I'm an aspiring Frontend Developer, currently based in Sofia, Bulgaria. **

I spent the first 6 years of my career working both as as a Business Developer and a Project Manager in the IT industry. During this time, I realized I'd much rather be involved in the actual creation of digital products. I used my free time to try out different web technologies and work on a few side projects. 

This helped me find a fulltime job as a Frontend Developer and that's the start of my coding journey. 

Some of my active side projects include [Finders/Keepers](http://finderskeepers.pro) and [Podcast Chatterbox](https://pdocastchatterbox.com). You can check out more on my [personal website](https://rmanev.com).
